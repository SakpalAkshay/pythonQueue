A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the element that is added to the queue first will be the first one to be removed.

**enqueue:** adds an item to the back of the queue.

**dequeue:** removes and returns the front item from the queue.

**peek:** returns the front item without removing it.

**is_empty:** checks if the queue is empty.

**size:** returns the number of elements in the queue.

## Simplified Explanation

Queue in Real Life - Movie Theater Line

Imagine you're at a movie theater waiting to buy tickets for the latest blockbuster movie. There's a line of people ahead of you, and you're the last person to join the line. This line of people waiting for tickets is very much like a queue data structure. Let's break it down:

### First-In-First-Out (FIFO): 
Just like in a queue, the person who arrived at the ticket counter first will be the first one to get their ticket and enter the theater. In other words, the person at the front of the line will be served first.

### Enqueue: 
When new people arrive at the theater, they join the line by standing at the back of the queue. This is analogous to the enqueue operation in a queue data structure. People are added to the end of the line.

### Dequeue: 
As the ticket seller serves each customer, they are removed from the front of the line and allowed to enter the theater. This is similar to the dequeue operation in a queue. The person at the front of the line is removed and served.

### Peek: 
If you want to know who is at the front of the line without actually removing them, you can peek or look at the first person. This is similar to the peek operation in a queue.

### Queue Size: 
You can also count how many people are in the line to buy tickets. This is similar to the size operation in a queue.

Empty Queue: 
If there are no people in the line, it's considered empty. This is similar to an empty queue in a data structure.
